## Who am I
### I am Luke Macumber, married with two beautiful girls, currently residing in Bendigo, Victoria. 
Throughout my life I have always loved the Tech industry, I was a student in Computer Science at Latrobe University in 94, I then moved into a Systems Support Officer role with Nestle for 3 years.  I took a detour into the hospitality industry running 9 separate hotels, and after many years I then followed my passion of trading into a position on a trading floor as a Proprietary Trader.  Trading FX, it was here I learnt the art of automated trading using MQL4.  Love, love, love this and continue doing still.  From here I took one step back into hospitality and bought a hotel.
